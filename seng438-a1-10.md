## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

In this lab session, our team managed to get familiar with the bug tracking system Jira and gain a deeper understanding on how to report and track defects. We underwent several iterations of testing the system under test (SUT) using different methods - namely exploratory testing, manual functional testing and regression testing.
Prior to attending this lab session, our understanding of exploratory and manual functional testing was rather abstract since we did not have any experience with testing beforehand. We understood exploratory testing as a form of testing that required tests to be designed and executed concurrently. This meant that exploratory testing cannot be scripted or automated, but it could be prepared in depth prior to the execution. This form of testing enables testers to have more freedom in the way they test the SUT. 
On the other hand, we understood manual functional testing to be a form of testing which does not require scripting or automation, and tests the SUT by studying the functional requirements of the system closely. This form of testing can systematically evaluate whether the features work as specified by the requirements of the software.

## High-Level Description of the Exploratory Testing Plan<a name="paragraph1"></a>

The main functions to be targeted are dispensing cash from an account, depositing cash into an account, checking what happens when a transaction fails and whether turning off the atm during a transaction leads to a crash. The approach to be taken would be to test most functions a little bit. We will come up with the test plan by testing the most common paths that a user will take, as well as testing what happens if an unexpected user action is performed.

## Comparison of Exploratory and Manual Functional Testing<a name="paragraph2"></a>

Both exploratory and manual functional testing had their advantages and disadvantages during the testing of this system. Exploratory testing allowed us to find some of the major bugs that an average user would experience if they were just using the system for day to day use. Manual functional testing instead allowed for us to test some of the deeper functions that you may not think about not working, along with allowing for us to easily see if there is any difference between the expected outcome from the actual outcome. This was one major downfall of exploratory testing due not knowing exactly what the expected outcome is beforehand.

Manual functional testing was also a much more efficient form of testing for us, as we could ensure that we were not overlapping test cases as we could split the cases up between us,. Meanwhile in the exploratory phase we only had a rougher outline of what to test which led to lots of overlap between the pairs.

## Notes and Discussion of the Peer Reviews of Defect Reports<a name="paragraph3"></a>

In order to test the other pair's work, we firstly compiled all of our bug reports into a Jira board, then removed overlapping findings. We then tested all of the bugs that the other pair had found to see if those bugs existed for all of the members. 


## How the Pair Testing was Managed and Team Work/Effort was Divided <a name="paragraph4"></a>

How we divided the pair testing was splitting up Luis and Kairos together, while Sayma and Ty paired together. Both pairs during the exploratory phase each tested all of the 4 functions, and saw if there were any big bugs. For the manual functional testing phase the same pairs each took 20 of the 40 test cases. Those 20 were further split into groups of 10, in which each member of the pair would test and record bugs, then swap for the second set of ten.

## Difficulties Encountered, Challenges Overcome, and Lessons Learned<a name="paragraph5"></a>

Though this project was fairly straightforward, we did run into some issues when it came to categorizing bugs. We were sometimes unsure if an odd functionality was a bug or was a purposeful implementation in the system, such as having to enter your PIN number twice after getting it wrong the first time. We decided with this particular situation that it did count as a bug as it seemed unusual.

Another challenge was familiarizing ourselves with the Jira software to track our bugs as a group. We all had to take some time to create accounts and practice reporting bugs with the right format and clear explanations on how to recreate the bug. Through this practice we learned how to use this project software effectively to convey bugs in a program and categorize them by priority.

Some of the lessons that were learned from the teamwork in this lab is that it was much more efficient to use “pair testing” in some of the aspects of the lab. Pair testing allowed the group to be faster in catching bugs and testing the program as there essentially was twice the work being done in the same amount of time compared to if the group just worked in a group of 4 to catch all the bugs.

## Comments/Feedback on the Lab and Lab Document Itself<a name="paragraph6"></a>

Our team agrees that this lab session was extremely insightful in helping us to understand the differences between the three types of testing that was carried out. The lab document provided the necessary structure for our team to understand the problem at hand and organize our thoughts. In particular, the defects report enabled us to learn to use the JIRA software to raise bugs and sort them accordingly based on their status. This will be a useful skill in the future, especially in our pursuit to being software engineers, as JIRA is a popular management tool in AGILE/SCRUM teams.
